## This is a video manager that can compress and convert videos

You can easily compress the video or change the video format. It uses NodeJs and ffmpeg.

The main idea: I wanted to build a tool to convert videos for web (.webm). On the current implementation, you can convert to many other video formats.

You are free to use this project however you want.
I would also be happy if you want to contribute to it.

This is the [postman collection](./Video%20Manager.postman_collection.json) if you need.

## How to use this project

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

You will probably need to install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) as well.

That should be it.
